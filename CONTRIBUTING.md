## Committing and Pushing changes

This project uses (or soon will) [`semantic-release`](http://npm.im/semantic-release)
to do automatic releases and generate a changelog based on the commit history. So we
follow [a convention](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)
for commit messages. Please follow this convention for your commit messages.

You can use `commitizen` to help you to follow [the convention](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)

Once you are ready to commit the changes, please use the below commands

1. `git add <files to be comitted>`
2. `$ npm run commit`

... and follow the instruction of the interactive prompt.
